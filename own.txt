Before the Civil War, if you were black and born a free man, you could still be forced into slavery. Thatâ€™s what happened to Solomon Northup. Northup was born a free man in Minerva, New York in 1808. He was a
 carpenter and talented drummer. In 1834, he and his wife moved to Saratoga Springs, New York, where they had
 three children. In 1841 , Northup met two men who claimed to be from a circus.
