Almost all states in America have a sate fair. They last for one, two or three weeks. The Indiana sate fair is one of the largest and oldest sate fairs in United Sates. It is held every summer. It started in 1852. Its goals were to educate, share ideas, and present Indiana's best products. The cost of a single ticket to enter the fair was 20 cents. During the early 1930’s, officials of the fair ruled that the people could attend by paying with something other than money. For example, farmers brought a bag of grain in exchange for a ticket. With the passage of time, the fair has grown and changed a lot, but it’s still one of Indiana’s most celebrated events. People from all over Indiana and from many other sates attend the fair. They can do many things at the fair. They can watch the judging of the price cows, pigs, and other animals. They can see sheep getting their wool cut, and they can learn how that wool is made into clothing. They can watch cow giving birth. In fact, people can learn about animals they would see except at the fair. The fair provides a chance for the farming communities to show its skills and farm products. For example, visitors might see the world’s largest apple, or the tallest sunflower plant. Today, children and adults at the fair can play new computer games, or attend more traditional games of skill. They can watch performances put on by famous entertainers. Experts say such fairs are important, because people need to remember that they’re connected to the earth and its products, and they depend on animals for many things.
